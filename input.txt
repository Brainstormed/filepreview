In the quiet of the night, under the moon's soft glow,
Whispers of the wind, in the leaves they blow.
Stars above, they twinkle, in the vast, dark sky,
Guiding sailors home, through the endless sea.

In the heart of the forest, where the shadows play,
Nature's secrets whisper, in the softest sway.
Flowers bloom in silence, in the gentle breeze,
Each petal a promise, of love's sweet release.

Beneath the ancient oak, where the river flows,
Fish dart and swim, in the water's glow.
Birds sing their songs, in the morning light,
A symphony of nature, in the softest night.

In the quiet of the dawn, as the sun begins to rise,
Nature's beauty unfolds, in the softest skies.
From the mountains high, to the valleys deep,
Nature's heart beats strong, in the softest sleep.

So, let us cherish, this beautiful world,
For in its beauty, we find our worth.
In the quiet of the night, and the dawn's first light,
Nature's whispers tell us, of love's sweet flight.
