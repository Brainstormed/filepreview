# FILE PREVIEW 

This is a very rudimentary file previewing utility built using C. It is not a very good idea to use this application (you can just use cat). It does show line numbers though. So, if that's what you need, go ahead.

You can either grab a release (only for Linux) or build from source.

## Building from source

### Clone the git repo


`$ git clone https://github.com/brainstormed/filepreview.git`

`$ cd filepreview`

`$ clang main.c -o filepreview -lm`

`$ mv filepreview /usr/bin/`

(My knowledge in both c and Linux is very laughable so please excuse me...)
